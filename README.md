## Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET` | `/disa-returns-backend/reporting-window/status/:zReference` | Gets submission's authoritative reporting-window status. |
| `GET` | `/disa-returns-backend/monthly/:zReference/:taxYear/:month` | Gets an existing monthly return. |
| `GET` | `/disa-returns-backend/monthly/:zReference/:taxYear/:month/files/:reference` | Gets a file upload for a monthly return. |
| `DELETE` | `/disa-returns-backend/monthly/:zReference/:taxYear/:month/files/:reference` | Deletes a file upload from a monthly return. |
| `POST` | `/disa-returns-backend/monthly/:zReference/:taxYear/:month` | Creates a monthly return. |
| `POST` | `/disa-returns-backend/monthly/:zReference/:taxYear/:month/declarations` | Declares an existing monthly return. |
| `POST` | `/disa-returns-backend/monthly/:zReference/:taxYear/:month/files` | Creates a file upload placeholder for a monthly return. |
| `PUT` | `/disa-returns-backend/monthly/:zReference/:taxYear/:month/nilReturn` | Updates whether the monthly return is a nil return. |
| `POST` | `/disa-returns-backend/monthly/upscan/callback/:zReference/:taxYear/:month` | Receives the Upscan callback for a monthly return file upload. |

Path parameters:

- `zReference`: ISA manager reference in `Z1234` format. Lowercase values are accepted and normalised to uppercase.
- `taxYear`: Tax year in `2026-27` format.
- `month`: Month number from `1` to `12`, for example `5` for May.

Invalid path parameters return `400 Bad Request`.

The monthly return and reporting-window status endpoints above require a valid bearer token with an activated
`HMRC-DISA-ORG` enrolment whose `ZREF` identifier matches the path Z-reference.
Requests with no or invalid bearer token return `401 Unauthorized`.
Requests with a valid bearer token but no matching DISA enrolment return `403 Forbidden`.

The Upscan callback and test-only endpoints are not secured by this bearer-token/enrolment check.

### Reporting Window Status

`GET /disa-returns-backend/reporting-window/status/:zReference`

The path Z-reference is normalized to uppercase after authentication and must be in `Z1234` format. The endpoint
proxies `disa-returns-submission`, which remains the source of truth, and returns only:

```json
{
  "reportingWindowOpen": true
}
```

- Returns `400 Bad Request` for an invalid Z-reference.
- Returns `401 Unauthorized` for a missing or invalid bearer token.
- Returns `403 Forbidden` without an activated matching `HMRC-DISA-ORG`/`ZREF` enrolment.
- Returns `503 Service Unavailable` when authentication fails internally or submission's status lookup still fails after its upstream-5xx retries.

### Create Monthly Return

`POST /disa-returns-backend/monthly/:zReference/:taxYear/:month`

Request body:

```json
{
  "nilReturn": false
}
```

- Returns `201 Created` with the generated `submissionId` and the resource path in the `Location` header.
- Returns `409 Conflict` when a monthly return already exists for the same `zReference`, `taxYear`, and `month`.
- Returns `409 Conflict` when `disa-returns-submission` already has a declared monthly return for the same `zReference`, `taxYear`, and `month`.
- Returns `503 Service Unavailable` when MongoDB is unavailable.
- `submissionId` is returned by `disa-returns-submission` at creation time and is stored by the backend for later updates.
- A monthly return created with `"nilReturn": true` is created without file uploads.

Example response:

```json
{
  "submissionId": "1d3df389-98d4-4fd1-b05d-88473fcba6ba"
}
```

### Declare Monthly Return

`POST /disa-returns-backend/monthly/:zReference/:taxYear/:month/declarations`

- Returns `204 No Content` when the record exists and has not already been declared.
- Returns `409 Conflict` when `disa-returns-submission` already has a declared monthly return for the same `zReference`, `taxYear`, and `month`.
- Returns `404 Not Found` when the monthly return does not exist.
- Returns `422 Unprocessable Entity` when the request is outside the declaration period.
- Returns `503 Service Unavailable` when MongoDB is unavailable.
- The declaration window status is read from `disa-returns-submission` using the request Z-reference.
- Before reading the local return, the backend checks submission's reporting-window status; a closed window returns `422`. The status GET retries upstream 5xx failures.
- The declaration POST is not retried. Submission code `MONTHLY_RETURN_ALREADY_DECLARED` maps to backend `409`, and `DECLARATION_PERIOD_CLOSED` maps to backend `422`. An unknown, missing, or malformed submission `422` code is treated as an upstream failure and returns `503`.
- Declarations are recorded in `disa-returns-submission`; this service does not store declaration state locally.

### Create File Upload

`POST /disa-returns-backend/monthly/:zReference/:taxYear/:month/files`

Request body:

```json
{
  "reference": "2b4d6f3a-8c1e-4e4b-9c7a-123456789abc"
}
```

- Returns `201 Created` with the file upload resource path in the `Location` header when the file upload placeholder is created.
- Returns `409 Conflict` when a file upload already exists with the same `reference`.
- Returns `404 Not Found` when the monthly return does not exist or cannot accept file uploads.
- Returns `422 Unprocessable Entity` when `disa-returns-submission` already has a declared monthly return for the period.
- Returns `503 Service Unavailable` when MongoDB is unavailable.

### Get File Upload

`GET /disa-returns-backend/monthly/:zReference/:taxYear/:month/files/:reference`

- Returns `200 OK` with the file upload when the monthly return and file upload exist.
- Returns `404 Not Found` when the monthly return does not exist.
- Returns `404 Not Found` when the monthly return exists but the file upload does not exist.
- Returns `503 Service Unavailable` when MongoDB is unavailable.

Example response:

```json
{
  "reference": "2b4d6f3a-8c1e-4e4b-9c7a-123456789abc",
  "status": "CREATED",
  "createdOn": "2026-05-17T12:00:00Z"
}
```

### Delete File Upload

`DELETE /disa-returns-backend/monthly/:zReference/:taxYear/:month/files/:reference`

- Returns `204 No Content` when the monthly return and file upload exist. The file upload is removed from the monthly return.
- Returns `404 Not Found` when the monthly return does not exist or the file upload does not exist.
- Returns `503 Service Unavailable` when MongoDB is unavailable.

### Get Monthly Return

`GET /disa-returns-backend/monthly/:zReference/:taxYear/:month`

- Returns `200 OK` with the monthly return when the record exists.
- Returns `404 Not Found` when the monthly return does not exist.
- Returns `503 Service Unavailable` when MongoDB is unavailable.
- The response `declaredOn` value is read from `disa-returns-submission`, which is the source of truth for monthly return declarations.

Example response:

```json
{
  "zReference": "Z1234",
  "submissionId": "1d3df389-98d4-4fd1-b05d-88473fcba6ba",
  "taxYear": "2026-27",
  "month": 5,
  "nilReturn": false,
  "fileUploads": [],
  "createdOn": "2026-05-17T12:00:00Z",
  "declaredOn": "2026-05-17T12:00:00Z",
  "lastUpdated": "2026-05-17T12:00:00Z"
}
```

### Update Nil Return

`PUT /disa-returns-backend/monthly/:zReference/:taxYear/:month/nilReturn`

Request body:

```json
{
  "value": true
}
```

- Returns `200 OK` with the updated monthly return when the record exists.
- Setting `value` to `true` removes all file uploads from the monthly return.
- Setting `value` to `false` updates `nilReturn` to `false` and leaves file uploads empty.
- Missing or non-boolean `value` fields return `400 Bad Request`.
- Returns `404 Not Found` when the monthly return does not exist.
- Returns `422 Unprocessable Entity` when `disa-returns-submission` already has a declared monthly return for the period.
- Returns `503 Service Unavailable` when MongoDB is unavailable.

### Monthly Upscan Callback

- The endpoint accepts Upscan `READY` and `FAILED` callback payloads and returns `202 Accepted` when the payload is valid.
- If the monthly return is a nil return, the callback still returns `202 Accepted` but the file result is not stored.
- If the monthly return is not a nil return, the callback only completes an existing file upload with the same reference in `CREATED` state. Callbacks for missing, deleted, or already-completed references return `202 Accepted` but are not stored.
- Completed file uploads include `fileUploadDetails.upscanCompletedOn`, which records when Upscan processing completed, and `fileUploadDetails.upscanDownloadUrl` for the Upscan download URL.
- If a successful callback has a checksum that already exists on another file upload for the monthly return, the upload is stored with status `DUPLICATE` and is not downloaded or validated.
- Invalid JSON, unknown `fileStatus` values, or unknown `failureReason` values return `400 Bad Request`.
- Non-JSON requests return `415 Unsupported Media Type`.

Successful upload callback example:

```json
{
  "reference": "2b4d6f3a-8c1e-4e4b-9c7a-123456789abc",
  "downloadUrl": "https://fus-outbound-bucket.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/object-key?X-Amz-Signature=...",
  "fileStatus": "READY",
  "uploadDetails": {
    "fileName": "return.csv",
    "fileMimeType": "text/csv",
    "uploadTimestamp": "2026-05-17T12:00:00Z",
    "checksum": "396f101dd52e8b2ace0dcf5ed09b1d1f030e608938510ce46e7a5c7a4e775100",
    "size": 1024
  }
}
```

Stored file upload after a successful callback:

```json
{
  "reference": "2b4d6f3a-8c1e-4e4b-9c7a-123456789abc",
  "status": "UPSCAN_SUCCESS",
  "createdOn": "2026-05-17T12:00:00Z",
  "fileUploadDetails": {
    "fileName": "return.csv",
    "fileMimeType": "text/csv",
    "uploadTimestamp": "2026-05-17T12:00:00Z",
    "checksum": "396f101dd52e8b2ace0dcf5ed09b1d1f030e608938510ce46e7a5c7a4e775100",
    "size": 1024,
    "upscanDownloadUrl": "https://fus-outbound-bucket.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/object-key?X-Amz-Signature=...",
    "upscanCompletedOn": "2026-05-17T12:01:00Z"
  }
}
```

After Upscan success, file upload processing downloads the file, validates it, uploads the original file to object-store as the upload reference, and stores validation metadata under `fileUploadDetails`.
Uploads stored with status `DUPLICATE` skip this processing.
If the Upscan download URL has expired before processing downloads it, the upload is stored with status `UPSCAN_EXPIRED`; the work item is marked as `PermanentlyFailed` and is not retried.

Stored successful validation example:

```json
{
  "reference": "2b4d6f3a-8c1e-4e4b-9c7a-123456789abc",
  "status": "UPSCAN_SUCCESS",
  "createdOn": "2026-05-17T12:00:00Z",

      "rowsValidated": 100,
      "validationErrors": 0,
      "status": "ValidationSuccess"
    }
  }
}
```

Stored failed validation example:

```json
{
  "objectStoreFileLocation": "2b4d6f3a-8c1e-4e4b-9c7a-123456789abc",
  "objectStoreFileErrorsLocation": "2b4d6f3a-8c1e-4e4b-9c7a-123456789abc-errors",
  "validation": {

        "errorCodes": ["E010", "E022", "E132"]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Failed upload callback example:

```json
{
  "reference": "2b4d6f3a-8c1e-4e4b-9c7a-123456789abc",
  "fileStatus": "FAILED",
  "failureDetails": {
    "failureReason": "REJECTED",
    "message": "MIME type [application/zip] is not allowed for service: [disa-returns-frontend]"
  }
}
```

- Supported failure reasons are `QUARANTINE`, `REJECTED`, and `UNKNOWN`.

## Work Items

### File Upload validation

Successful Upscan `READY` callbacks enqueue a file upload work item after the monthly return file upload has been completed successfully, unless the callback is stored as `DUPLICATE`.
The work item contains the monthly return key and upload reference:

```json
{
  "zReference": "Z1234",
  "taxYear": "2026-27",
  "month": 5,
  "reference": "2b4d6f3a-8c1e-4e4b-9c7a-123456789abc"
}
```

The `MonthlyReturnWorkItemJob` polls the `monthlyReturnFileUploadWorkItems` collection and processes outstanding work items asynchronously.

The `MonthlyReturnWorkItemJob` job validates the file upload in `MonthlyReturnFileUploadProcessingService`, and stores the validation result in `FileUploadDetails.validation` field.

The original uploaded file is stored in object-store. If row-level validation errors are found, an errors file is also uploaded to object-store containing the row number and semicolon-separated error codes for each invalid row.

Example errors file:

| RowNumber | ErrorCodes |
| --- | --- |
| `1` | `E010;E022;E132` |
| `2` | `E020;E030` |

The `MonthlyReturnWorkItemJob` is started by `AppInitialiser` after internal-auth token initialisation succeeds. Startup is not blocked while internal-auth initialisation is in progress, but the work item job is not started until it completes successfully.

Work item configuration lives in `conf/application.conf`:

```hocon
contexts {
  monthly-return-file-upload-work-item {
    fork-join-executor {
      parallelism-min = 2
      parallelism-factor = 1.0
      parallelism-max = 8
    }
  }

  file-upload-blocking {
    type = Dispatcher
    executor = "thread-pool-executor"
    throughput = 1

    thread-pool-executor {
      fixed-pool-size = 4
    }
  }
}

monthly-return-file-upload-work-item-job {
  pollInterval = 1 second
  failedRetryAfter = 1 minute
  inProgressRetryAfter = 5 minutes
}

fileUploadMaxInlineErrors = 25
```

Config purpose:

- `contexts.monthly-return-file-upload-work-item` defines the dispatcher used by the background monthly return file upload work item workers.
- `contexts.monthly-return-file-upload-work-item.parallelism-min` sets the minimum number of dispatcher threads available to the job.
- `contexts.monthly-return-file-upload-work-item.parallelism-factor` scales dispatcher threads relative to available processors.
- `contexts.monthly-return-file-upload-work-item.parallelism-max` caps the dispatcher thread pool.
- `contexts.file-upload-blocking` defines the dispatcher used for blocking file-upload work, including CSV/XLSX validation and object-store file size/MD5 calculation.
- `contexts.file-upload-blocking.thread-pool-executor.fixed-pool-size` caps how many blocking file-upload tasks can run at once.
- `monthly-return-file-upload-work-item-job.pollInterval` controls how long the job waits before polling again when no work item is available.
- `monthly-return-file-upload-work-item-job.failedRetryAfter` controls how long a failed work item waits before it can be retried.
- `monthly-return-file-upload-work-item-job.inProgressRetryAfter` controls when an `InProgress` work item becomes eligible to be pulled again if it has not completed. This prevents stuck work items from being hidden forever.
- `fileUploadMaxInlineErrors` controls how many row-level validation error entries are stored inline on `FileUploadValidationResult`. The full errors workbook still contains all row-level validation errors.

### Monthly File Upload Error Codes

Monthly CSV and XLSX uploads return row-level validation error codes in `validation.inlineErrors` and in the uploaded errors workbook. The workbook contains the row number and a semicolon-separated list of these codes.

| Error code | Column name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |

## Before running the app

This repository relies on having mongodb running locally. You can start it with:

```bash
# first check to see if mongo is already running
docker ps | grep mongodb

# if not, start it
docker run --restart unless-stopped --name mongodb -p 27017:27017 -d percona/percona-server-mongodb:7.0 --replSet rs0
```

Reference instructions for [setting up docker](https://docs.tax.service.gov.uk/mdtp-handbook/documentation/developer-set-up/install-docker.html) and [running mongodb](https://docs.tax.service.gov.uk/mdtp-handbook/documentation/developer-set-up/set-up-mongodb.html#install-mongodb-applesilicon-mac).

## Running the app

### Service manager
The whole service can be started with:
```bash
sm2 --start DISA_RETURNS_ALL
```

### Locally

```bash
sbt run
```

To run locally with HMRC-style test-only routes enabled:

```bash
sbt run -Dapplication.router=testOnlyDoNotUseInAppConf.Routes
```

If starting through service-manager, pass the same JVM parameter in the local service profile:

```bash
-Dapplication.router=testOnlyDoNotUseInAppConf.Routes
```

The following test-only routes are available only with that router:

- `GET /disa-returns-backend/test-only/overrides/:zReference`
- `PUT /disa-returns-backend/test-only/overrides/:zReference`
- `DELETE /disa-returns-backend/test-only/overrides/:zReference`
- `DELETE /disa-returns-backend/test-only/monthly-returns`
- `DELETE /disa-returns-backend/test-only/monthly-return-file-upload-work-items`
- `GET /disa-returns-backend/test-only/file-upload/monthly/:filename`
- `GET /disa-returns-backend/test-only/file-upload/monthly-expired-download`

`disa-returns-submission` must also run with the same test-only router before the aggregate override routes can be used.

Monthly-period validation uses the Z-reference-scoped `TimeSource` abstraction. With the normal router, `SystemClock`
returns the current system time in UTC. With the test-only router, `TestOnlySubmissionTimeSource` uses submission's optional
clock override date at midnight UTC, falling back to the backend `SystemClock` when no clock override is present.

Use `GET` to inspect the configured overrides:

```bash
curl http://localhost:1207/disa-returns-backend/test-only/overrides/Z1234
```

Responses contain only `zReference` and nullable `clock` and `reportingWindow` objects. `PUT` fully replaces both
overrides; use `null` to leave either override unset:

```bash
curl -X PUT -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"clock":{"date":"2026-05-20"},"reportingWindow":null}' \
  http://localhost:1207/disa-returns-backend/test-only/overrides/Z1234
```

Use `DELETE` to clear both overrides:

```bash
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:1207/disa-returns-backend/test-only/overrides/Z1234
```

The backend `GET` proxies submission's Z-reference-scoped aggregate route. `PUT` calls submission's bulk replacement
route with one Z-reference and then returns that aggregate. `DELETE` calls submission's bulk delete route and returns
the empty aggregate. Submission is the sole source of truth; backend does not persist overrides. All three routes
return `503 Service Unavailable` when submission cannot satisfy the request.

Use the monthly returns cleanup route to remove all backend monthly returns from the local database before automation runs:

```bash
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:1207/disa-returns-backend/test-only/monthly-returns
```

Use the monthly return file-upload work-item cleanup route to delete all monthly return file-upload work-item documents from `monthlyReturnFileUploadWorkItems`:

```bash
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:1207/disa-returns-backend/test-only/monthly-return-file-upload-work-items
```

This deletes all local file-upload validation work-item documents, regardless of status; it does not drop the collection.

### Running the test suite

To run the unit tests:

```bash
sbt test
```

To run the integration tests:

```bash
sbt it/test
```

### Test-Only Endpoints

Test-only endpoints require the service to be running with `-Dapplication.router=testOnlyDoNotUseInAppConf.Routes`.
Otherwise the routes will not be available.

| Endpoint | Used by | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET /disa-returns-backend/test-only/overrides/:zReference` | Frontend test utility and `bruno/TestOnly/Overrides` | Read submission's aggregate overrides. |
| `PUT /disa-returns-backend/test-only/overrides/:zReference` | Frontend test utility and `bruno/TestOnly/Overrides` | Fully replace submission's clock and reporting-window overrides. |
| `DELETE /disa-returns-backend/test-only/overrides/:zReference` | Frontend test utility and `bruno/TestOnly/Overrides` | Clear both submission overrides. |
| `DELETE /disa-returns-backend/test-only/monthly-returns` | `bruno/TestOnly/MonthlyReturns` | Remove all backend monthly returns from the local database before automation runs. |
| `DELETE /disa-returns-backend/test-only/monthly-return-file-upload-work-items` | `bruno/TestOnly/MonthlyReturnFileUploadWorkItems` | Delete all local file-upload validation work-item documents from `monthlyReturnFileUploadWorkItems`. |
| `GET /disa-returns-backend/test-only/file-upload/monthly/:filename` | `bruno/MonthlyReturn/Validation` | Serve copied local validation tests from `conf/test-only/file-upload/monthly` so Bruno can use them as Upscan `downloadUrl` values. |
| `GET /disa-returns-backend/test-only/file-upload/monthly-expired-download` | `bruno/MonthlyReturn/Validation/21-200-upscan-expired` | Return an S3-style expired Upscan download response so Bruno can verify `UPSCAN_EXPIRED` processing. |

`bruno/TestOnly/MonthlyReturns/01-204-clear-monthly-returns` also clears monthly returns for the collection's configured Z-references from `disa-returns-submission` before calling the backend cleanup route, so Bruno scenarios start from a clean declaration source of truth.

The monthly file-upload test endpoint only serves simple `.csv` and `.xlsx` filenames copied into `conf/test-only/file-upload/monthly`. The files are runtime resources so they are available when running locally or through service-manager with the test-only router enabled. The expired-download endpoint does not serve a file; it returns `403 Forbidden` with an S3 `AccessDenied` / `Request has expired` XML body.

#### Override test utilities

The aggregate override routes proxy state maintained by `disa-returns-submission`; backend does not persist override
state locally. `PUT` is a full replacement, not a patch. `DELETE` clears both the clock and reporting-window override.

```json
{
  "clock": { "date": "2026-06-20" },
  "reportingWindow": {
    "startDate": "2026-06-19T23:59:00Z",
    "endDate": "2026-06-20T00:01:00Z"
  }
}
```

Each route returns aggregate JSON containing only `zReference` and nullable `clock` and `reportingWindow` objects.
For `DELETE`, both override fields are null. Invalid Z-references or malformed replacement bodies return `400`;
submission failures return `503`.

Monthly file-upload validation tests are maintained in `it/resources/file-upload/monthly` for integration tests and copied to `conf/test-only/file-upload/monthly` for local Bruno/service-manager use. The same filenames exist in both locations.

#### Monthly File Upload Test Files

| Name | Formats | What it tests |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `blank-invalid` | `.csv`, `.xlsx` | Blank or effectively empty file. Expected result: `VALIDATION_FAILURE` with validation status `InvalidFile` and no errors workbook. |
| `empty-row-invalid` | `.csv`, `.xlsx` | Header plus an empty data row. Expected result: `VALIDATION_FAILURE` with required-field inline errors and an errors workbook. |
| `garbage-invalid` | `.csv`, `.xlsx` | File content cannot be parsed as a valid upload in the declared format. Expected result: `VALIDATION_FAILURE` with validation status `InvalidFile` and no errors workbook. |
| `inline-error-limit-exceeded-invalid` | `.csv`, `.xlsx` | Multiple invalid rows to prove inline errors are capped while the full errors workbook is still uploaded. Expected result: `VALIDATION_FAILURE` with an errors workbook. |
| `invalid-header` | `.csv`, `.xlsx` | Header row does not match the expected monthly upload template. Expected result: `VALIDATION_FAILURE` with validation status `InvalidFile` and no errors workbook. |
| `isa-closed-valid` | `.csv`, `.xlsx` | Valid closed ISA monthly return row with closure fields. Expected result: `VALIDATION_SUCCESS`. |
| `isa-open-valid` | `.csv`, `.xlsx` | Valid open ISA monthly return row. Expected result: `VALIDATION_SUCCESS`. |
| `lisa-closed-valid` | `.csv`, `.xlsx` | Valid closed LISA monthly return row with closure fields. Expected result: `VALIDATION_SUCCESS`. |
| `lisa-open-valid` | `.csv`, `.xlsx` | Valid open LISA monthly return row with LISA-specific fields. Expected result: `VALIDATION_SUCCESS`. |
| `row-errors-invalid` | `.csv`, `.xlsx` | One data row with row-level validation errors for national insurance number, first name, and current year subscriptions. Expected result: `VALIDATION_FAILURE` with an errors workbook. |

When using `OBJECT_STORE_STUB` locally, object-store stores files under its filesystem-backed stub and exposes them through its list endpoint. After a successful validation run, this command lists files uploaded by `disa-returns-backend`:

```bash
curl -s \
  -H "Authorization: valid-internal-auth-token-disa-returns-backend" \
  http://localhost:8464/object-store/list/disa-returns-backend | jq
```

The `Authorization` header must match `internal-auth.token`. The path `disa-returns-backend` must match the object-store resource location used by this service. A successful response includes uploaded original files, and row-level validation failures also upload an `-errors` workbook.

To download one of the listed files, call the `location` returned by the list response on the same object-store host. For example:

```bash
curl -s \
  -H "Authorization: valid-internal-auth-token-disa-returns-backend" \
  http://localhost:8464/object-store/object/disa-returns-backend/validation-isa-open-valid-csv \
  --output validation-isa-open-valid.csv
```

For an errors workbook, use the `-errors` location and save it as `.xlsx`:

```bash
curl -s \
  -H "Authorization: valid-internal-auth-token-disa-returns-backend" \
  http://localhost:8464/object-store/object/disa-returns-backend/validation-row-errors-invalid-csv-errors \
  --output validation-row-errors-invalid-csv-errors.xlsx
```

### Bruno Collection

The Bruno collection is under `bruno/MonthlyReturn` and is organised into:

- `Create`
- `Declarations`
- `Delete`
- `Get`
- `Update`
- `UpscanCallback`
- `Validation`

Monthly return Bruno setup requests call the test-only cleanup route for the collection's configured Z-references. This avoids collisions with old backend and `disa-returns-submission` data. Upscan callback setup also clears monthly return file-upload work items before creating a fresh callback scenario. Do not run these Bruno folders in parallel, because cleanup requests delete all monthly returns from the backend, delete scoped monthly returns from `disa-returns-submission`, and delete monthly return file-upload work items from the local database.

These Bruno requests clear monthly returns by calling `TestOnly/MonthlyReturns/01-204-clear-monthly-returns` in their pre-request script:

| Request | Why it clears monthly returns |
| --- | --- |
| `MonthlyReturn/Create/01-201-create-nil-return-false` | Creates a clean baseline return using the configured `zReference`, `nilZReference`, and `missingZReference`. |
| `MonthlyReturn/Create/05-409-create-after-submission-declaration` | Creates and declares a return directly in `disa-returns-submission`, then verifies backend create is blocked. |
| `MonthlyReturn/Declarations/00-201-create-return-for-declaration` | Creates a clean return using the configured declaration references. |
| `MonthlyReturn/Declarations/04-404-declare-missing` | Ensures the declaration reference is missing. |
| `MonthlyReturn/Declarations/07-201-create-return-outside-period` | Clears existing returns, then creates the clean return used for the outside-period declaration scenario; request `06` only applies the outside-period clock override. |
| `MonthlyReturn/Declarations/11-409-declare-after-submission-declaration` | Creates a backend return, declares it directly in `disa-returns-submission`, then verifies backend declaration is blocked. |
| `MonthlyReturn/Declarations/12-422-create-file-after-submission-declaration` | Creates a backend return, declares it directly in `disa-returns-submission`, then verifies file creation is blocked. |
| `MonthlyReturn/Delete/00-201-create-return-for-delete` | Creates a clean return for file delete tests using the configured `deleteZReference`. |
| `MonthlyReturn/Update/07-422-update-after-submission-declaration` | Creates a backend return, declares it directly in `disa-returns-submission`, then verifies nil-return updates are blocked. |
| `MonthlyReturn/UpscanCallback/00-201-create-return-for-success-callback` | Clears monthly return file-upload work items and creates a clean callback scenario using the configured `callbackZReference`. |

Many later requests run one of these setup requests from their pre-request script, so they can also clear monthly returns indirectly. For example, `MonthlyReturn/Get/01-200-get-existing` runs `MonthlyReturn/Create/01-201-create-nil-return-false`, and `MonthlyReturn/Update/02-200-set-nil-return-false` runs the update setup chain.

Run executable Bruno folders explicitly against a running local service, for example `bru run MonthlyReturn/Get --env Local --bail`. The setup scripts create the data each folder needs. The Upscan callback folder creates a fresh non-nil monthly return with `callbackZReference`, creates a file upload placeholder with `POST /files`, gets that file upload with `GET /files/:reference`, sends a READY callback, then gets the monthly return to confirm the completed file upload was recorded. It also includes a duplicate callback flow that creates a second upload with the same checksum and asserts the stored status is `DUPLICATE`.

The Validation folder uses the copied monthly file-upload tests as local Upscan downloads. Each validation request creates a fresh file-upload scenario, sends a READY callback with a test-only file URL, waits for processing to reach the expected upload status, then asserts the final validation result and object-store locations. Scenario `21-200-upscan-expired` uses the expired-download test endpoint and asserts the terminal `UPSCAN_EXPIRED` status.

`bruno/TestOnly/ValidationHelpers` contains support requests used by the validation scenarios. They are guarded with the runtime variable `runValidationHelpers`, so they no-op safely if the whole collection runs them directly.

`bruno/TestOnly/Overrides` verifies aggregate GET, replacement, deletion, combined clock/reporting-window payloads,
and invalid Z-reference handling. Shared clock setup and cleanup requests operate on the configured monthly-return
Z-references; the combined-field request uses `overrideZReference`, `reportingWindowOverrideStart`, and
`reportingWindowOverrideEnd`.

The backend override Bruno helpers call backend only; backend proxies each scoped operation to submission. They do not
test the production reporting-window status route.

`validationProcessingPollIntervalMs` is defined in `bruno/environments/Local.bru` and defaults to `1000`. It is used by the processed validation requests in `bruno/MonthlyReturn/Validation`, currently the test-specific `01` to `21` checks. The polling gives the asynchronous monthly return file-upload work-item job time to download, validate, upload to object-store, and update Mongo before Bruno performs the final GET/assertions.

To change it permanently for local runs, edit `bruno/environments/Local.bru`:

```text
validationProcessingPollIntervalMs: 1500
```

Bruno Z-references are configured in `bruno/environments/Local.bru` and copied into runtime variables with
`bru.setVar`; requests do not generate random references or rewrite the environment file.

The collection pre-request script logs in through `auth-login-api` once per run and creates an activated
`HMRC-DISA-ORG`/`ZREF` enrolment for every configured monthly-return Z-reference. It supplies the returned bearer token
to secured backend requests.

The callback requests return `202 Accepted`. Completed file upload details appear on the GET after the READY callback in the collection run. Duplicate callback details appear on the GET after the duplicate callback with status `DUPLICATE`.
